# v1.1 Introducing Mandolins #
  * Modify `Guitar` class to be `abstract StringInstrument`. `Guitar` and `Mandolin` inherit from `StringInstrument`.
  * Modified access of fields in `StringInstrument` from `private` to `protected`
  * Added `stringCount` field to `Guitar`
  * Added `MandolinBuilder`, which serves parallel functionality to `GuitarBuilder`
  * 

# Note #
  * Guitar string count is not searchable because the author considers it too arbitrary a search parameter

# TODO #
  * resolve issues from hw #2
